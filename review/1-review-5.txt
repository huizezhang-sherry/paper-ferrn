This work presents visual diagnostic tools for different methods of projection pursuit optimization. They use line plots, PCA and the tour method to visually compare the behavior of different optimizers. Finally, they showcased the analysis of three optimizers using their tool. 

The tool is likely to be of interest to the R community.  Most of my comments are about the technical aspect of the content. The writing is overall good, but please see my comment under the "writing" regarding to the clarity of the text.

## Major comment

- "Sometimes, two optimisers can start with the same basis but finish with bases of opposite sign...However, this creates difficulties for comparing the optimisers since the end bases will be symmetric to the origin. A sign flipping step is conducted..." and the "Reconciling the orientation" section
  - For 1D projections, flipping the sign is sufficient. For p-D projections of $\mathbb{R}^n$​, one may need a little more. To my knowledge most index functions are invariant to any rotations that happens within the p-subspace. This makes me wonder that in general, one may want to align two bases so that their difference does not contain any "within-subspace" components. In other words, one may want to compare representations in the Grassmannian manifold  (space of k-subspaces) instead of in the Stiefel manifold (space of orthonormal k-frames).

## Minor comment

- The software seems to be specific to projection pursuit. I wish the authors could comment more on its potential generality to other optimizations. For example, can one generalizes the tour method to visualize any parameter trace of an optimizer?   

- Figure 4 "...All the bases in PD have been flipped for easier comparison of the final bases..."
  - This is related to the major comment. In the figure, PD flipped in sign but stopped at a basis representation similar to the destination of the CRS. Flipping the sign back, does it mean that PD and CRS diverged but stopped at the similar subspace with opposite basis representations? Also, given that PD and CRS have the same starting bases and one is flipped, why wouldn't the dashed line pass the origin (gray dot) in the figure?
- "Recall that the columns in a 2D basis are orthogonal to each other, so the space of *p* × 2 bases is a *p*-D torus"
  - It is not clear to me why "so". For p=2, the space of 2x2 bases is a pair of 1-D tori instead of just one (because you have two orientations for a pair of orthogonal vectors), right? For p=3, the space of 3x2 bases is SO(3), which is not a 3-D torus? Ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiefel_manifold

## Writing

- "Along with the bases recorded during the optimisation and a zero basis, the parameters (centre and radius) of the 2D space can be estimated by PCA. The centre of the circle is the first two PC coordinates of the zero matrix, and the radius is estimated as the largest distance from the centre to the basis."
  - It took me multiple passes to get what this means. Perhaps instead starting with something like: "We use PCA to project and visualize the parameters/bases in 2D. The centre of the 2D view is..."?
- "Figure 6 shows some frames from the tour plot of the same two optimisations in its original 5D space."
  - I think this is the first mention of "5D space"/5D data in the main text (apart from the caption in Figure 4), so it may be worth clarifying what the original 5D space is. 

- "While the previous few examples have looked at the space of 1D bases ...  2D bases"
  - I don't think the terms "1D bases" and "2D bases" are standard. Perhaps (orthonormal) "1-frames" and "2-frames"?
